# Stock Price Prediction Using (Social) Media Sentiments  
This project is part of DS 340W and explores the relationship between financial sentiment and market movements, guided by insights from three key papers: **StockEmotions**, **CEO Post Impact**, and **MAN-SF**.

## Parent Papers
1. **StockEmotions**: Explores emotional analysis of stock-related posts on social media to predict market trends.

2. **CEO Post Impact**: Investigates how CEO statements on social media impact stock price and sentiment.

## Potential Implementation Datasets
We utilize financial news and analytics data to implement models and test hypotheses derived from the parent papers:
- **[Daily Financial News for 6000+ Stocks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguelaenlle/massive-stock-news-analysis-db-for-nlpbacktests/data?select=raw_analyst_ratings.csv)** (Kaggle)
- **[FNSPID Financial News Dataset](https://github.com/Zdong104/FNSPID_Financial_News_Dataset)** (GitHub)
- **[Labeled Stock News Headlines](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johoetter/labeled-stock-news-headlines)** (Kaggle)

## Project Overview
This repository includes:
- **Sentiment analysis models**: Based on findings from the **StockEmotions** and **MAN-SF** papers.
- **Market impact studies**: Using the **CEO Post Impact** framework to explore how leadership communication affects stock trends.
- **Code implementations**: Scripts to preprocess data, train sentiment models, and evaluate performance.

## Goals
- Investigate how sentiment in news and social media posts correlates with stock market fluctuations.
- Apply and enhance techniques from the MAN-SF and CEO Post Impact studies using up-to-date datasets.
- Provide meaningful insights into financial sentiment using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.
